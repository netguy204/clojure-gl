# clojure-gl

A quick example of using lwjgl and NativeGuide from clojure to create
a spinning triangle.

By using nativeguide we're able to support

$ lein uberjar

To create a single completely standalone jar that should load the
appropriate native GL libraries for Mac (64 bit), Windows (32 or 64
bit), and Linux (32 or 64 bit).

## Usage

$ lein deps

then:

$ lein run
or
$ lein uberjar
$ java -jar thejar.jar
